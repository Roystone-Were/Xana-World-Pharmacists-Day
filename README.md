# Xana World Pharmacists Day Walk: Registration Site

Single-page registration site for the **Saturday 26 September 2026** walk
(held in celebration of World Pharmacists Day, Friday 25 September 2026;
TRM Mall → Xana Plus, Ruiru). Brand-matched to the xana-skincare inspiration
site: deep green `#005c3a`, orange accent `#f58a07`, cream `#faf8f6`,
Manrope display + Plus Jakarta Sans body.

## 1. Set your email (required, 1 minute)

Every registration is emailed to the organizer. Open `config.js` and replace:

```js
organizerEmail: "organizer@xanapharmacy.com",
```

with your real inbox, e.g. `organizerEmail: "you@xanapharmacy.co.ke",`.

It uses **FormSubmit (free, no backend)**. The first submission triggers a
one-time activation email from FormSubmit to that inbox. Click **Activate**,
and every later sign-up flows straight in with the subject
"New registration: Xana World Pharmacists Day Walk".

## 2. Preview locally

Just open `index.html` in a browser, or serve it:

```powershell
npx serve "C:\Users\user\_Projects\XanaPharmacy\World_Pharmacist_Day"
```

## 3. Deploy to Vercel (your shareable link)

Option A (drag and drop): https://vercel.com/new → import this folder.
Option B (CLI):

The resulting `https://…vercel.app` link is what you send to participants.
